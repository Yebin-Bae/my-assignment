## **Understanding Mental Distress In New Zealand**

This infographic provides an in-depth analysis of mental distres in New Zealand, highlighting significant ethinic variations. 
Data from 2011 to 2021 shows that Maori and Pacific populations experience higher rates of mental distress than other ethnicities, with depression, anxiety, disorders, ADHD, and bipolar disorder being more prevalent among them.
Self-rated health assessments indicate that Maori individuals report the highest levels of fair or poor health and the lowest levels of excellent or very good health. 

Several factors may contribute to these disparities, including increased fast food consimption, insufficiernt sleep, and barriers to accessing healthcare, such as the high cost of general practitioner visits. 
The findings emphasize the need for targeted interentions to improve mental health support, address systemic healthcare barriers, and promote healthier lifestyle choices. 

## **Which aireline has the best rating and why**

China Southern Airlines stands out with the highest passenger recommendation rate, as only 1.03% of travelers reported they would not recommend it, compared to 7.45% for Hainan Airlines and 15.16% for ANA All Nippon Airways.
